The VEX Robotics Competition is an educational robotics program where students design, build, and program robots to compete in exciting annual challenges on a designated field. Participants work in teams to solve specific game objectives, navigating obstacles, manipulating objects, and scoring points. It spans various levels, from elementary school to university, and encourages creativity and innovation in a competitive and collaborative environment.

<h3>Common Problem</h3>


In the autonomous phase where the robot must collect and shoot disks autonomously, precise motor control is necessary. Feedback controllers, like the PID Controller commonly used in VEX, enhance accuracy by leveraging sensor data. However, setting optimal gains is a challenge, as CSUN VEX learned. We had taken a trial and error  approach but this isn't always feasible in the ever-changing competition setting.

<h3>Possible Solution</h3>

Using the VEX companion app in simulink we can create a chassis model of a VEX U competition robot. Because it is hard to model the VEX robot the automatic PID tuner is very useful for finding the gain values of the PID controller used by the robot for the 45 second autonomous portion of the VEX challenge
